                I am currently a web development bootcamp student. 
                Before web development, I had a background in architectural fabrication and aerospace manufacturing. 
                Through this, I came to enjoy the design process and creating something tangible from nothing. 
                Soon after, I developed an intense interest in rock climbing. 
                This new interest in climbing sparked a desire for flexibility in my work-life. 
                Through this desire, I discovered web-development and immediately fell in love with learning a completely new way of building something from nothing. 
                This is a collection of my completed projects.
